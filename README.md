# From Expression to Experiment: Predicting Cell Condition

**Authors:** Charlotte Daumal & Clemence Kiehl  
**Context:** This mini-project was completed as part of the *Introduction to machine learning for bioengineers* course taught by Prof. Johanni Brea at EPFL  
**Language:** Julia   
**Date:** December 2022

## üìù Project Description  

In an experiment on epigenetics and memory, Giulia Santoni (from the lab of Johannes Gr√§ff at EPFL) measured the gene expression levels in multiple cells of a mouse brain under three different conditions that we call KAT5, CBP and eGFP. In this project, the goal is to predict ‚Äì as accurately as possible ‚Äì for each cell the experimental condition (_KAT5_, _CBP_ or _eGFP_) under which it was measured, given only the gene expression levels.

## üß† Methods & Models

To solve this classification task, we implemented and compared several linear and nonlinear models:

- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Neural Network  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## üìù Requirements

- All `.jl` scripts should be run from within the root of the repository

> **Note:** Some models (especially nonlinear ones) may take a long time to run depending on your machine.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to use it ?

1. Download the `.ZIP` files from our shared [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19PFEhJPrm3AXHuXpxQQnzs8CfaN4v8bU?usp=share_link)
2. Create a folder named `data/` at the root of the repository
3. Move the downloaded ZIP files into the `data/` folder
4. Unzip the files
5. Run any `.jl` file from the `/src/` directory to:
   - Visualize or denoise the data
   - Train and evaluate a model
