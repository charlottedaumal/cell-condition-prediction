# Epigenetics and Memory ML Project
The goal of our Machine Learning mini project is to predict under which experimental conditions different cell types were measured, given their gene expression level.

## Requirements



## Methods used to build models

We used several linear and nonlinear method to achieve our results, such as :

* Logistic regression
* Random Forest Classification
* Neural Network
* Simple KNN Classifier

## Organisation

One can find our mini project under the *ClemenceKiehl/Epigenetics_and_Memory_ML_Project* repository. It contains:

* a folder **src** that contains our code in the format of .jl scripts, more specifically:
 * a file
* a folder **visualization** that contains the different visualizations of the data, more specifically:
* a folder **models_assessment** that contains some evaluations of our models such as graph of the proprotion of variance explained on the training dataset according to the data's predictors and confusion matrices of all models.
* a report which explains how we cleaned/visulaized the data, which linear and nonlinear methods we implemented and the results we got.

## Instructions to run our code

1. Download the .ZIP files available in this repository on Google Drive : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19PFEhJPrm3AXHuXpxQQnzs8CfaN4v8bU?usp=share_link
2. Place these files in a folder named "data" in the GitHub repository on your computer.
3. Run any file from the src folder to eitehr visualize the data or run specific linear or non-linear models.
