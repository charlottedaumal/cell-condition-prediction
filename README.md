# Epigenetics and Memory ML Project
The goal of our Machine Learning mini project is to predict under which experimental conditions different cell types were measured, given their gene expression level.

## Requirements

* Download the .zip files available in this repository on Google Drive : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19PFEhJPrm3AXHuXpxQQnzs8CfaN4v8bU?usp=share_link

## Methods used to build models

We used several linear and nonlinear method to achieve our results, such as :

* Logistic regression
*  Random Forest Classification
* Neural networks
* PCA visualization

## Organisation

One can find our mini project under the *ClemenceKiehl/Epigenetics_and_Memory_ML_Project* repository. It contains:

* A PDF file which explains the linear and nonlinear methods we implemented and the results it gave us.
* a README file


## How to run our code

## Team Members

* Charlotte Daumal
