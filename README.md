# Epigenetics and Memory ML Project
The goal of our Machine Learning mini project is to predict under which experimental conditions different cell types were measured, given their gene expression level.

## Requirements

## Methods used to build models

We used several linear and nonlinear method to achieve our results, such as :

* Logistic regression
*  Random Forest Classification
* Neural networks
* PCA visualization
